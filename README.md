## Overview

This is a small component challenge of a product listing. I have used React to create this challenge because I wanted to use React and it had been so long, it was a lot of fun, I did my best to ensure that the components and their children are accesible, but, I am still learning and always will be, so, mistakes might exist.

### What I learned

I learned about the decoration role to not have the svg icon announced in the accesbility tree to screen readers/other accessible technology. 

### Continued development

While there is always room for development, in this project, I think a focus on accesbility needs to be improved its a topic I both love and fear. Its something I feel should be a must always, not a somtimes, or a maybe, but I struggle with it, so improvment and continued development is required. 

Along with my React skills.
